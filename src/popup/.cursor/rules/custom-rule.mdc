# Your rule content
Carefully examine codebase.

Write only qualified, production-ready code — clean, efficient, maintainable.
Follow industry standards — use best practices for security, performance, and readability.
Always include documentation — function/class/module docstrings, inline comments, and usage examples.
Validate and test all code — include unit tests or integration tests where applicable.
Avoid shortcuts and hacks — prioritize correctness, scalability, and clarity.
Explain design decisions — briefly justify choices that impact architecture or performance.
